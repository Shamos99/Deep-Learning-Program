This is still a bit rough.

The java file 'main.java' runs the entire program. It allows you to draw images on a JFRame and then gives you 3 main options:

1) Test! - which runs 'Alpahbet.py' through the shell and gives a guess as to what the image was.
2) Save - which saves the pixel data of the image along with what letter it is in 'data.txt' and 'letter.txt' respectively.
3) Learn - which runs all the current image data through the AI for five epohcs and updates it.

To make this work for you, it is important that in 'main.java' you fix the filepaths in the functions testQuery, saveImage and upDateModel, so that these work for you.
